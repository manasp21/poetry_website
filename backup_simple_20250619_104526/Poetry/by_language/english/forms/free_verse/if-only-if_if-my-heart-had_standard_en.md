If my heart had wings
It would fly to you every day
And whisper in your ear
How much I love you and need you

If my life was all bliss
It would be because of you
And your sweet kisses
That fill me with warmth and delight

If my dreams came true
It would be to hold you forever
And gaze into your eyes
That sparkle like diamonds in the night

If my words had power
I would say only three
And make you feel them deeply
I love you, I love you, I love you
