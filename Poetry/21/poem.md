As I move swipe my hands
through the words I wrote,
There is a gentle breeze
in my heart that flows,
Trying to feel the emotions,
I had
When I put you to paper.

Seeing that glimpse I had of you,
Reminds me now of nothing more,
Cause I moved on from love,
Like I moved on from truth.

My Honesty lying in the sun,
While I wait in shade for others.
Though the Dusk never comes.

Sigh, Heart skips a beat,
Words Guide a new tone.

As I trace the letters of your name,
I feel a spark ignite my soul,
Burning with a secret flame,
That only you can control.

You are the moon that guides my night,
The star that brightens my sky,
The dream that fills my sight,
The reason why I try.

But you are also far away,
Beyond my reach and touch,
A memory that fades by day,
A pain that hurts too much.

So I write these words to you,
Hoping you will see,
The love that I still have for you,
The love that sets me free.
