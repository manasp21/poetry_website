You played the fool, and I was childish too
We chased our dreams, but fell and hurt ourselves
You never hid the truth that shone in you
Your smile was false, your love was on the shelves

You never said the words I longed to hear
You always pulled away when I came near
So why did you not tell me why you left
And broke my heart with one goodbye, bereft

I'm lost and broken, I don't know what to do
I love you still, I can't forget your face
I try to drown my pain, but it's no use
Your memories haunt me, I can't erase

We were a pair of fools, in love and blind
But now you're gone, and I'm the one who's left behind
