Why is the moon so alluring?
Is it cause of it's moonlight,
Which is sun's reflection.
Nope,
It's cause of its scars,
Scars which attract the intensed.

Similarly for people, To state Lex Fridman's Quote
"Imperfections are beautiful. They are the window into a person's complexity, depth, and character".
.
Moon's photo taken by me in 2019,
Ignore the exposure at right.
I don't know why I added John Wayne as the music.
