She was all fire and fury,
a heart of molten rock,
spilling her jagged truths to the sky.
She thought herself a lonely peak.

He, a cool and deep expanse,
held the secrets of the abyss in his soul.
He saw her burning anger,
and was not afraid.

He reached for her,
a constant, patient touch upon her feet.
She bled her fire into him,
a hiss, a steam, a fury of creation.

And in their meeting,
new land was born from her passion
and his calm embrace,
a black sand shore where they could finally hold hands.
