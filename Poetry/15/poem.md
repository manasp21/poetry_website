Have been since I wrote a verse,
Tell me, Have I turned worse?

They say,
A poet in love is one to read indeed,
Or the one who's after a sorrow deed?

I say,
Poems do come from the heart,
A lot better when it is hurt.

Hmm,
Does sadness bother your imploud smile,
Or the moment takes a bit more while.

I try,
To express myself in words I only can understand,
So it doesn't touch other hearts unplanned.

That's why,
I wrote this poem for myself or someone,
Who knows? Maybe her I try to shun.
