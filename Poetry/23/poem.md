In a world where shadows dance and play,
A woman stands, radiant as the day.
She's like the sun, a celestial blaze,
Her brilliance piercing through life's haze.

Like sunlight streaming through trees so tall,
Her radiance cascades, breaking down walls.
Through every obstacle, she finds her way,
Unyielding, unstoppable, come what may.

They try to cover her, hide her light,
But she defies their darkness, shining bright.
Just like the sun, she cannot be contained,
Her brilliance surging, cannot be restrained.

Through nets and sieves, her glow does pass,
Defying boundaries, like tempered glass.
Her spirit soars, a phoenix in flight,
Dispelling shadows, igniting the night.

No prejudice can dim her inner flame,
For she is fierce, a force to reclaim.
She rises above, with grace and might,
Breaking chains, embracing her own light.

In a society that seeks to confine,
She emerges, a symbol so divine.
A woman shining, against all odds,
Guiding others, like a beacon of gods.

So let her shine, in her own unique way,
Embracing her power, day after day.
For just like the sun, she'll never cease,
Her radiance everlasting, bringing peace.
