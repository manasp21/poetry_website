I left my home
To chase my dreams
To find a place
Where I belong

I thought I knew
What I wanted
To study hard
To work well

But soon I found
That dreams are not
What they seem to be
When reality hits

I felt the stress
The pressure
The loneliness
The emptiness

I needed an escape
From the hectic life
From the false hopes
From the broken promises

I looked around
And saw no place
That could give me peace
That could make me happy

Then I remembered
My home
The place I left
The place I escaped

I realized then
That home is not
A prison or a burden
But a refuge and a blessing

Home is where
I can be myself
I can be loved
I can be free

Home is where
I find my joy
I find my strength
I find my purpose

Now I long to go back
To my home
To see my family
To feel their warmth

Home is not what I escaped from
Home is what I escape to.
