Time is a cruel mistress, she never waits
For the brave souls who dare to love
She ticks and tocks, she steals the fates
Of those who seek the stars above

You long for someone's warmth and light
You yearn for their presence in your life
You reach out to them with all your might
Even if they don't, you face the strife

But time is a cruel mistress, she never stops
She mocks the hearts that beat as one
She runs and laughs, she breaks the bonds
Of those who dream of the rising sun

You crave for someone's friendship and support
You hope for their loyalty by your side
You share with them your deepest thoughts
Even if they don't, you open wide

But time is a cruel mistress, she never stays
She shatters the hopes that glow so bright
She hides and flees, she dims the rays
Of those who wish for the moonlight

You fall for someone's charm and grace
You ache for their love in your heart
You show them your true self and face
Even if they don't, you play your part

But time is a cruel mistress, she never returns
She buries the memories that linger on
She flies and dies, she leaves you to burn
Of those who sing for the dawn

So don't wait for the perfect moment
Cause even if the clock is wrong, the chance is right
Don't let time be a cruel mistress to you
Cause in life, times matter few.
