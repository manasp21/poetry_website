Fast fast,
Before it lasts,
Who knows what's chasing you?

Maybe it's a secret,
That you wish you never knew,
Maybe it's a person,
Who's not who you thought they were.

Maybe it's a feeling,
That you can't bear to face,
Maybe it's a memory,
That you can't erase.

Whatever it is,
Don't look back,
Just run away,
And don't lose track.

Maybe it's a shadow,
That lurks behind the light,
Maybe it's a nightmare,
That haunts you every night.

Maybe it's a voice,
That whispers in your ear,
Maybe it's a doubt,
That fills you with fear.

Whatever it is,
Don't slow down,
Just keep going,
And don't turn around.

Maybe it's a trap,
That waits for you to fall,
Maybe it's a lie,
That makes you doubt it all.

Maybe it's a choice,
That you can't decide,
Maybe it's a fate,
That you can't avoid.

Whatever it is,
Don't give up,
Just fight back,
And don't give in.

Fast fast,
Before it lasts,
Who knows what's chasing you?
