A heart was here
it had two wings

a heavenly lover
who kissed it on the lips of the wind
A small heart beating fast
ascending from the depths of the earth
visiting flowers and stars

like a charming lively guest
bringing roses and jasmine to the garden
whispering to the nocturnal dreamers on its wings:
‘Fly with me to the moon
and embrace the sun and
soar to Paris and Rome’
Sometimes it sang joyfully at others
sorrowfully It was a heart with two wings

a heavenly lover
who kissed it on the lips of the wind
But they clipped its wings
so it fell down to the ground and died, slowly, of pain.
