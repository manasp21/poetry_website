Your Rhythm and Muse,
Only I can deduce,
Your gait and every trait,
I am the one to celebrate.
Your heartbeat, your breath,
I can listen from far.
You every move,
I notice, I count.
Your Deepest fantasies,
I can Understand.
The complexities of your scars,
into I dive.
The lines you write, the words you speak,
I appreciate.
