Look at me once again,
Still Locked in your first Glimpse,
I am.

Again Hear my heart,
That stopped the day I felt you.

Stay close to me,
Even when you're far.

Never thought I'd say a goodbye,
To you.
The day I lost my heart.

Have I felt this before,
In a past life.
How can I know?

My thoughts make me Cry,
Like a pierced Butterfly.
Lost in the Field of your touch,
Without any way to out clutch.

Maybe
my sadness drowned
In the fear of you,
Knowing how much I love you,
Everyday I do....

Have had sleepless Nights,
Knowing not what to do.
Buy still lost in the Abyss,
I am.
An Abyss created by,
By the Void of you.
