I say,
Tissue papers make great bookmarks, They wipe the tears that come after reading a sad part.

You say,
Tissue papers are just waste, They clutter the pages and ruin the taste.

I say,
Coffee mugs are my inspiration, They remind me of the morning sensation.

You say,
Coffee mugs are too common, They don’t show any speciality.

I say,
Books are my dreams, They take me to places I’ve never seen.

You say,
Books are too boring, They don’t make me feel anything.

I say,
Flowers are my hope, They show me that life is precious.

You say,
Flowers are too fragile, They don’t survive the harsh weather.

I say,
Music is my therapy, It heals me with its harmony.

You say,
Music is too noisy, It doesn’t let me think clearly.

I say,
To love is to life.

You say,
To live is to survive.
