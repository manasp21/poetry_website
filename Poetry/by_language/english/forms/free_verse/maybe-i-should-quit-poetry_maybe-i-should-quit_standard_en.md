Maybe I should Quit Poetry,
It gives me a heart ache everytime,
Smallest words can make my soul whine,
More than an overflowing Rhine.

Maybe I should Quit Poetry,
Meaningless it is, like love, like life,
My lyrics always tries to strife,
End all it with the scratch of a knife.

Maybe I should Quit Poetry,
For it mirrors my deepest fears,
Each stanza, a cascade of tears,
Echoing through the silent years.

Maybe I should Quit Poetry,
Its verses, a relentless tide,
Unveiling the pain I hide,
In every metaphor, I confide.

Maybe I should Quit Poetry,
Yet, itâ€™s my solace in the night,
A flicker of hope, a distant light,
Guiding me through the darkest plight.

Maybe I should Quit Poetry,
But in its embrace, I find my voice,
A bittersweet, inevitable choice,
To let my heartache rejoice.
