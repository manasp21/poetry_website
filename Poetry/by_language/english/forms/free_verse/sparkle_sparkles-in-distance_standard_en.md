"Sparkles in Distance",
I tell I see.
"Emptiness in light",
I seem to believe.
"Dim lonely nights",
I think I enjoy.
"Pleasant mornings with cotton clouds",
I feel I dream.
"Nature's Beauty",
I show I adore.
"Simplicity of life",
I care I miss.
"Dreamer's mind",
I pride I wish.
"Depths in people",
I try to find.
"Meaning of Everything"
I wonder it exists.
