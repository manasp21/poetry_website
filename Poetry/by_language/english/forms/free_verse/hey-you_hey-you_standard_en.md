Hey you,
I love your eyes.
I get lost in it's sight,
More lost than a thousand starry night.

Shows me pain you hide,
Also secrets you confide.
Sometimes dreams that died,
Lost loves over which you cried.

Hey you,
I love your smile.
Radiant and never a disguise,
Even when fake I like despise.

Tells me of the joy you hold,
Happiness supposed.
Or sadness in seal,
You try to conceal.

Hey You,
I love you.
My heart's a mess,
For you it's restless.

Can I ever tell you that,
Being Loner I am at.
You're this poemâ€™s muse,
Or Is it just my Excuse.
