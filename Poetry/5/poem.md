In moments sweet, where lips do meet,
Coffee's warmth, a kiss complete.

With beans' embrace, a mellow grace,
Awakened senses find their place.

Smooth cocoa dream, lips interlace,
Passion blooms, hearts find their space.

Chocolate's charm, a different scene,
Velvet sweetness, love's routine.

Coffee's dawn, a tender start,
A sip of love, a throbbing heart.

Two worlds collide, in love's embrace,
Coffee's comfort, a warm solace.

Chocolate's touch, a sugared spell,
Desire's dance, a tale to tell.
