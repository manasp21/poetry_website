What are we, if not lost souls in the sea of life.
Aimless broken imperfect beings swimming in it.
To just find a tide to hold, or maybe a land to reach.
Just Keep Swimming.
Swimming, hmm, I will.

What are we, if not captive birds in a sky of dreams.
Directionless apteral imbecile beings flying in it.
To find a wind to gust in, or a cloud to mix in.
Just Keep Flying
Flying, hmm, I will.

What are we, if not lone walkers in a void of emotions.
Senseless futile hollow beings wandering in it.
To just find another to guide, or maybe a friend to make.
Just keep wandering.
Wandering, hmm, I will.

Keep Swimming till we reach the Shore.
Keep Flying till we reach a stoa.
Keep Wandering till we reach a dosser.

Watching Philosophical animes with reading romantic novels makes my mind dwell at I place I can't even explain.
