In the stillness of night, we sway,
To the rhythm of whispered words we play,
A symphony of secrets, a love profound,
In the realm of listening, our souls are bound.

The moon gazes upon our tender embrace,
As stars bear witness to our intimate space,
Their shimmering light, a celestial guide,
As our hearts intertwine, side by side.

For in the realm of listening hearts, love is born,
Where the spoken and unspoken, so beautifully adorn,
With each word, a new constellation we create,
Guided by the celestial bodies, we navigate.
