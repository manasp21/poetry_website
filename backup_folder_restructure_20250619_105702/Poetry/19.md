Within the depths of my untamed soul,
I am a boy, unpredictable and bold.
Impulsive, I venture into the unknown,
Seeking new experiences that I can call my own.

In the shadows of my restless heart,
A yearning for love, a longing to impart.
A hopeless romantic, dreaming of a connection,
Yet unrequited love is my heart's affliction.

I dance through life with a fiery desire,
Chasing love's flames that flicker and inspire.
But fate plays its game, a cruel charade,
Leaving my heart empty, unclaimed, betrayed.

I whisper tender words to the moon above,
Hoping they'll carry my longing, my love.
But the night remains silent, my pleas unheard,
As love's sweet touch eludes like a fleeting bird.

Through the labyrinth of passion, I roam,
Writing love letters to an imagined home.
Yet my words linger in the vast expanse,
Lost in the void of unrequited romance.

Deep within my unpredictable ways,
A truth resonates, lighting my days.
I know, in the depths of my soul's decree,
Love will find me, and together, we'll be free.

So I keep journeying through life's grand stage,
Embracing the unpredictability, turning each page.
A heart ablaze with hope, a relentless fire,
Burning for love's embrace, my ultimate desire.

In the tapestry of life, I'll paint my own art,
Knowing that love will come, stitching hearts.
And when that moment arrives, like destiny's dove,
We'll fall in love together, guided by true love.
