I know a beautiful bird,
she is in an ugly cage,
not free, neither enrage,
I ask her,
"What's your allure,
if not free for sure?,
What's the point of being pure,
when you have so much to endure?".

She replies softly, her voice steady and clear,
"Beauty," she says, "is not just to appear,
It's in every moment, far or near,
In the song of life, we all hold dear."

"Freedom," she continues, "is the soul's right,
To dance in the sun and rest in the night.
Though these bars may hold me tight,
My spirit still takes its flight."

I ponder her words, so profound and true,
"Then beauty," I say, "lives on in you,
Not just in the open, under the sky so blue,
But in the strength and grace you show through."

"Yes," she sings, "beauty is a light that glows,
Not in perfection, but in the purpose it shows.
It's in the love that inside us flows,
And in the resilience that in adversity grows."

So we speak, the bird and I, of things deep and wise,
Of beauty and freedom, under the open skies.
And though she's in a cage, her spirit defies,
For beauty is free, no matter where it lies.
