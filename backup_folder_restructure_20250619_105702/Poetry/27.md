He loved her from the day he saw her face
She was his friend, but never knew his heart
He did for her all things with gentle grace
But never dared to tell her his true part

She loved another, who was not her match
He watched her suffer, and he gave her aid
He hoped that someday she would see his catch
But never spoke his feelings, he was afraid

He died before he could confess his love
She mourned for him, and found his letter late
She realized then, he was her turtle dove
But could not tell him, for she met her fate

They met again, in fields of reeds, beyond
They kissed and held, and found their love so fond
