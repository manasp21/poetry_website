I love winters,
My skin shivers,
I can see my breath,
I can feel a cold wind swaying around,
.
Birds on trees,
warm cosy nests,
.
.
"My tears are always frozen
I can see the air I breathe
Got my fingers painting pictures
On the glass in front of me
Lay me by the frozen river
Where the boats have passed me by
All I need is to remember
How it was to feel alive"
~ Aurora, Winter Bird.

P.S. That ain't snow.
