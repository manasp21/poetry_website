People are books
We see them every day
But we don't know what they say

Some have covers that catch our eye
Some have covers that make us sigh
Some have covers that we ignore
Some have covers that we adore

But the cover is not the book
It is only a glimpse
It does not reveal the plot
The characters, the theme, the twist

We have to read the book to know
We have to dive into its flow
We have to feel its highs and lows
We have to see how it grows

Only then can we judge the book
Only then can we relate to its hook
Only then can we enjoy its look

People are like books
We meet them every day
But we don't know what they feel

Some have hearts that are open and warm
Some have hearts that are closed and cold
Some have hearts that are broken and torn
Some have hearts that are whole and bold

But the heart is not the face
It is only a part
It does not show the soul
The depth, the passion, the grace

We have to know the person to see
We have to listen to their story
We have to understand their journey
We have to respect their glory

Only then can we love the person
Only then can we appreciate their reason
Only then can we share their vision
