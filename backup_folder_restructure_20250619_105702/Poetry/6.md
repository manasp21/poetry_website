Unrelatable are some things to me,
I need to understand,
cause I can't feel,
the burden of your skin.

Do you feel the wind like I do?
Does Cold also give shivers to you?
Does hell come on earth,
For you after every pain?

Does your skin bear the weight of the world?
Do you feel the scars, the stories unfurled?
Is your burden heavy, a silent scream?
Or a whisper of pain in a distant dream?

Do you carry the past in every pore?
Does each touch remind you of what's before?
Is your skin a shield, a fragile veil?
Or a canvas of tales, both bright and pale?

When you walk, does the ground feel the same?
Do you sense the whispers, calling your name?
Is your burden a cloak, worn with pride?
Or a shadow that follows, hard to hide?

Do you find solace in the nightâ€™s embrace?
Or does the darkness reveal every trace?
Is your skin a map of battles fought?
Or a testament to the strength you've sought?
