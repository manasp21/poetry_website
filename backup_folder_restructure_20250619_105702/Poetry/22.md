The vast expanse of skies above,
So deep and blue and filled with love,
A canvas for the clouds to play,
As they dance and drift and gently sway.

But gazing up, I can't help but see,
The memories of love that used to be,
Lost like stars that fade from sight,
Leaving only the darkness of the night.

Yet in the fields of flowers below,
There's a hope that starts to grow,
A promise of a new love's bloom,
Like petals opening to the sun's warm room.

The delicate beauty of each bloom,
Brings a promise of a love that's soon,
To fill the heart with joy and light,
And chase away the lonely night.

So though the skies may bring a tear,
The flowers remind me not to fear,
For love is always waiting near,
Just like the petals of a new frontier.
