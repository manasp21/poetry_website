//Tried to rhyme but the thoughts flush,
//Wanted to write before the feelings rush.//

Lost amidst the sea of faces,
In a crowd that's loud and wild,
I am but a lonely figure,
In this boisterous music-filled world.

The beat is strong, the bass is deep,
And I'm swaying to the sound,
But the emptiness I feel inside,
Is nowhere to be drowned.

I see people laughing, singing,
All around me they're alive,
But I'm just a ghost, a shadow,
In this music-filled hive.

I try to scream, to shout out loud,
But my voice is lost in the crowd,
No one hears my silent cry,
In this sea of music and sound.

I long for someone to reach out,
To break through this lonely spell,
But all I have is the music,
And the loneliness that it can't dispel.

So I close my eyes and let it all in,
The sound, the beat, the pain,
And I dance alone in this crowded place,
With my loneliness, my only refrain.

Hmm, Shit.
