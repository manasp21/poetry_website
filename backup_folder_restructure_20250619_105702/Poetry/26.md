Where the eyes take you.
.
At a place,
where sparkles blind your eyes.

At a time,
When dust seems like glitter.

In a crowd,
People but only oblivion.

In constant struggle,
But with no future to see.

Trying to figure out stuff,
Just for more to come.

Finding meaning of it all,
Just to find emptiness crawl.

To know what to do.
But "Why?" is what to ask,
Pointless it seems.

Busy with day-lives we get,
Just to live better in our night dreams.

Discovering new things to love,
Forgetting the ones who did us.

Simplicity of life we try to find,
But the more we dive the more complex it gets.

But I know,
Blank verses do shine,
Sometimes grammar needed not,
Not even words to rhyme.
