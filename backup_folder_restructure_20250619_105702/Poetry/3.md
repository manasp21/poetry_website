This Forest,
Drowns like Sadness.
These Green remind of my red heart,
Hard to see, or realise,
Maybe easier to Understand.
Today as I walk through the woods,
With this reviving smell.
I do realise the dead in me,
The me lost I did forget.

The redness of my blood,
The veins of my leaves,
Need a sun to grow,
Need light to know,
I want to show,
I want to show,
Every day I grow,
I want to show.

or something like...

Why do you beat so fast?
My Calm heart.
Why do you hide in glass?
My stained love.
Maybe I think to much
About me and you.
Every freckel of my soul,
Feels you somehow,
Every Glance of you,
Makes me fall too.
